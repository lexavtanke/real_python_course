'''
Write a script “high_scores.py” that will read in a CSV file of users' scores and
display the highest score for each person. The file you will read in is named
“scores.csv” and is located in the chapter 7 practice files folder. You should
store the high scores as values in a dictionary with the associated names as
dictionary keys. This way, as you read in each row of data, if the name already has a
score associated with it in the dictionary, you can compare these two scores and
decide whether or not to replace the “current” high score in the dictionary.
Use the sorted() function on the dictionary's keys in order to display an ordered
list of high scores, which should match this output:
